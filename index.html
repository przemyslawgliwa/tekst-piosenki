    <h1>Chandelier</h1>
    <p>Party girls don't get hurt<br>
    Can't feel anything, when will I learn <br>
    I push it down, push it down <br>
    <p>I'm the one "for a good time call" <br>
    Phone's blowin' up, they're ringin' my doorbell <br>
    I feel the love, feel the love</p>
    <p>One, two, three, one, two, three, drink <br>
        One, two, three, one, two, three, drink <br>
        One, two, three, one, two, three, drink</p>
    <p>Throw em back, till I lose count</p>
    <p>I'm gonna swing from the chandelier, from the chandelier <br>
      I'm gonna live like tomorrow doesn't exist <br>
      Like it doesn't exist <br>
      I'm gonna fly like a bird through the night, feel my tears as they dry <br>
      I'm gonna swing from the chandelier, from the chandelier</p>
      And I'm holding on for dear life, won't look down won't open my eyes <br>
      Keep my glass full until morning light, 'cause I'm just holding on for tonight <br>
      Help me, I'm holding on for dear life <br>
      Won't look down, won't open my eyes<br>
      Keep my glass full until morning light<br>
      'Cause I'm just holding on for tonight<br>
      On for tonight</p>
      <p>Sun is up, I'm a mess<br>
      Gotta get out now<br>
      Gotta run from this<br>
      Here comes the shame, here comes the shame</p>
      <p>Aaaaah</p>
      <p>One, two, three<br>
      One, two, three, drink<br>
      One, two, three<br>
      One, two, three, drink<br>
      One, two, three<br>
      One, two, three, drink</p>
      <p>Throw 'em back, till I lose count</p>
      <p>I'm gonna swing from the chandelier<br>
      From the chandelier<br>
      I'm gonna live like tomorrow doesn't exist<br>
      Like it doesn't exist<br>
      I'm gonna fly like a bird through the night<br>
      Feel my tears as they dry<br>
      I'm gonna swing from the chandelier<br>
      From the chandelier</p>
      <p>But I'm holding on for dear life<br>
      Won't look down, won't open my eyes<br>
      Keep my glass full until morning light<br>
      'Cause I'm just holding on for tonight<br>
      Help me, I'm holding on for dear life<br>
      Won't look down, won't open my eyes<br>
      Keep my glass full until morning light<br>
      'Cause I'm just holding on for tonight<br>
      On for tonight</p>
      <p>On for tonight<br>
      'Cause I'm just holding on for tonight<br>
      Oh, I'm just holding on for tonight<br>
      On for tonight<br>
      On for tonight<br>
      'Cause I'm just holding on for tonight<br>
      'Cause I'm just holding on for tonight<br>
      Oh, I'm just holding on for tonight<br>
      On for tonight<br>
      On for tonight</p>
